## *"Java and Javascript are similar like car and carpet." --My Friend Krishna* <br>

## I Might Need To Get A New New Year’s Resolution Already

Like many other people who create goals for the New Year, I had set a goal to grow professionally and learn a new language. 
However, I  was surprised to meet my language-learning goal within the first couple of weeks of the new semester. 
Going into this new year and new semester, I was actually quite eager to expand my toolbox and pick up a new programming language like Javascript. Javascript was one language that appealed to me in particular due to its wide usage and its potential to build interactive user interfaces and also games. <br><br>

## Initial Impressions

I think I was expecting JavaScript to be similar to Java. Yet when working with it, I found it to feel a bit more like Python due to the ambiguity that is allowed such as when declaring data types or scopes for variables. 
While this trait makes it a bit faster to code since I can omit certain portions of information (e.g. being able to simply declare a variable with “let” and not having to add the datatype to the definition), I suspect that it might be a bit more challenging to go back and review or revise the code when bug fixing. Additionally, I could only imagine that some of its quirks such as assigning automatic global scope may result in some unwanted interactions or bugs when engineering software if code is not carefully reviewed or planned.

Presonally, I really appreciate the explicitness of languages that require you to declare the variable type and scope like Java since I think that it makes it easier to stay organized, and it also makes bugfixing easier because the explicitness makes it easier for me to identify potential areas for problems. As of now, I have not yet built a project in Javascript; I have only completed a course on the basics with the help of Free Code Camp. So far, the parts that have challenged me the most with this language include: getting used to the ambiguuity, managing the scope of the variables, and understanding some errors or bugs that I encounter. 
For example, I recently declared an integer variable but did not assign an initial value to it, and I ended up getting an “NaN” result when using that variable due to the fact that I did not set it to zero at the start. 
While I found some of these aspects to be frustrating as someone who started with a language like Java, I still have a deep respect and appreciation for its long-lasting impact, its well-established community and resources, and its accessibility for people who may be new to coding! I anticipate and firmly believe that I will get a lot more comfortable with practice, and I am eager to learn and grow as a developer as I begin to build Javascript projects and deeply explore its capabilities and power.<br><br>


## "There is no substitute for hard work." -Thomas Edison 

I firmly believe that daily practice and exposure to daily coding workouts will help me grow quickly as a programmer. For anything in life, practice and hardwork can nurture talent and skills to mastery. I have already seen a ton of growth by being exposed to practice Leet code problems through my school’s Programming and Algorithms club (PandA). Although I am a sophomore currently, I am really trying to plan ahead for my professional goals by taking steps to becoming a strong programmer through exposure to practice problems to gain coding and problem-solving experience. 
I find a lot of practice problems to be very engaging since I love solving puzzles for fun, but I find that having time limits for problems in class with an all-or-nothing grading style to be incredibly stressful. Similarly to my past experiences with reading and English class, sometimes I worry that the pressure of school and grades will make another hobby feel like a chore. Yet regardless of these concerns, I believe that gaining experience in a hands-on way is still going to be incredibly conducive for growth as a programmer as I often find myself learning programming best through experience!
