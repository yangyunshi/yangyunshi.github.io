## Don't Reinvent The Wheel

The saying "don't reinvent the wheel" is a classic saying when it comes to problem-solving and innovation. It suggests that if a solution already exists for a problem, it's typically more efficient to simply use the existing solution rather than creating a new one from scratch. This principle is particularly relevant in fields such as software engineering. Just as the wheel is a well established tool for people, design patterns are well-established solutions for common software design problems.<br>
Design patterns are essentially the metaphorical wheels of software engineering. By using these pre-existing patterns or blueprints, engineers can save both time and effort while simultaneously ensuring the reliability and maintainability of their code due to the extensive testing of these existing solutions. Rather than spending valuable time on reinventing the wheel, software engineers can resourcefully utilize  and implement existing solutions and knowledge to complete their coding projects. Similarly to coding styles, consistant templates and guidelines can make it easy for teams to collaborate on software engineering.<br>
There are three design patterns in javascript: creational, structural, and behavioral. Creational design patterns offer ways to create new objects, flexibly optimizing the way objects are created for different situations. Structural patterns are related to class and object composition, helping to form larger structures by identifying simple ways to establish relationships between different objects. By using them, engineers and build larger complex structures using more manageable building blocks. And lastly, behavioral design patterns help improve communication between objects in a system. Each design pattern applied helps improve the quality of the code.
