## Don't Reinvent The Wheel

The saying "don't reinvent the wheel" is a classic saying when it comes to problem-solving and innovation. It suggests that if a solution already exists for a problem, it's typically more efficient to simply use the existing solution rather than creating a new one from scratch. This principle is particularly relevant in fields such as software engineering. Just as the wheel is a well established tool for people, design patterns are well-established solutions for common software design problems.<br><br>

Design patterns are essentially the metaphorical wheels of software engineering. By using these pre-existing patterns or blueprints, engineers can save both time and effort while simultaneously ensuring the reliability and maintainability of their code due to the extensive testing of these existing solutions. Rather than spending valuable time on reinventing the wheel, software engineers can resourcefully utilize  and implement existing solutions and knowledge to complete their coding projects. Similarly to coding styles, consistant templates and guidelines can make it easy for teams to collaborate on software engineering.<br><br>

There are three design patterns in javascript: creational, structural, and behavioral. Creational design patterns offer ways to create new objects, flexibly optimizing the way objects are created for different situations. Structural patterns are related to class and object composition, helping to form larger structures by identifying simple ways to establish relationships between different objects. By using them, engineers and build larger complex structures using more manageable building blocks. And lastly, behavioral design patterns help improve communication between objects in a system. Each design pattern applied helps improve the quality of the code and the overall organization.<br><br>

In life, I've often found that when a problem seems too challenging, the best approach is to break things down until they become more manageable, and I approach coding with a similar philosophy. In practice, I often utilize design patterns to integrate features without altering the existing code significantly such as when utilizing React components. React components, by isolating different features in different files and components, help to form more complex UIs. It help make it target the issue faster because I know exactly which file the button's code is in.<br><br>

Such clear organization makes the software engineering process much easier to navigate and manage, and design patterns serve as a great tool to keep in one's toolbox to enhance coding practices and save time. With such practices becoming well established, engineers can begin to focus more on advance problems and innovation rather than wasting time worrying about such details that are trivial with the help of design patterns.
