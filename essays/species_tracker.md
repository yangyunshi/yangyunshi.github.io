Invasive Species Tracker
Problem: Invasive species damage the local ecosystem, and it can be difficult to monitor or track them across the island.
Solution: A community based science initiative to bring the community together and educate the community on invasive species, empowering the community and researchers to be able to better track them and care for the ecosystem.
