While there is a learning curve to picking up a UI framework like Bootstrap 5, its value cannot be understated. UI frameworks help payoff in the end by streamlining the creation of a responsive web interface. As with any language being learned, one must invest time to learn before they can reap the rewards.

## Blueprints<br>
UI frameworks like Bootstrap provide many tools to help create a aesthetically pleasing functional website by providing commonly used basic tools and stylization (e.g. navigation bars and dropdown menus) without compromising on customizability. I've appreciated how they provide structure and a basic set up through classes which I can further customize. Such simplification helps make the process take less time by reducing the amount of time that's needed to build a website from scratch. I look at it kind of like a basic blueprint that I can build off of. In addition to this, it helps enable programmers to stick to relatively consistent standards such as matching margins and alignment. Through these frameworks, one can create a website responsive design that is cross-platform compatible. Typically, commonly used frameworks also have a large communtiy of users where one may be able to find help or other resources needed. <br><br>

## Building Blocks<br>
While UI frameworks like Bootstrap have the ability to streamline the UI creation process, they cannot completely replace coding with raw HTML and CSS. Customizing HTML with CSS offers more precise control over design elements on a webpage. These prove to be useful tools in any developer's toolkit when entering the professional scene. Having precise control over design elements can help a developer better optimize and meet the unique design requirements for various projects in addition to helping to give the page more personality and identity. <br><br> 

## Personal Journey<br>
At the beginning, it's been challenging learning so many tools and languages at the same time. However, it has been a lot of fun being able to see the power that some of these tools have.
