### I. Introduction


### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

  1. Experience WODs e.g. E18<br>
      I didn't really need to utilize AI for the Experience WODs as I found the screencasts explaining steps to be much more useful personally. I liked being able to walk through problems and see problem solving strategies in action. 
     
  3. In-class Practice WODs<br>
      Sometimes if I got stuck on a bug while working with the new material, it helped to have AI available to consult and ask where I was going wrong or misunderstanding something.

  5. In-class WODs<br>
     I didn't need to use AI for the WODs. Instead, I attended many practice session WODS and reviewed answers to prepare. I found it more beneficial to understand each element used in the practice WODs and homeworks and then translate it to the new WOD.

  6. Essays<br>
     I don't really like utilizing AI for essays. I feel that AI fails to capture my true voice and feelings accurately.

  8. Final project<br>
     I occassionally utilized AI to assist with understanding new material for the final project. I had never worked with backend development for a React app before this project so I had a lot of questions. AI would sometimes help me asnwer the questions I had or point me to problems that may need addressing.

  10. Learning a concept / tutorial<br>
      I tend to learn a lot by being able to ask the right questions so AI can sometimes prove useful when I am confused. Occasionally it spits out something that makes zero sense or fake information, but many times it can at least point me in the right direction or prompt my brain in a way that gets me to a correct answer or at least closer to an answer.

  12. Answering a question in class or in Discord<br>
      I have never needed to use it for questions in class. 

  14. Asking or answering a smart-question<br>
      By asking the right questions while researching, I didn't really end up needing to ask questions to the Smart-Questions channel. I also didn't need AI to answer the questions that I answered because the solutions to the problems had solutions that I either knew from personal experience or could deduce from reading the output errors and tracing the given code. 

  16. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”<br>
      Occassionally, documentation can be confusing and unclear to me even when I did some research. It helped to have AI available to consult as a resource when I felt I wasn't understanding something. Even being able to just see the code in use and understand what arguments it took and what it would spit out helped me understand what code would do, especially in code written in languages that are not as explicit (ex. Javascript and Python do not make programmers declare data types). It saved time because I did not have to go hunting for the original code source (if it was even publically available.)

  18. Explaining code<br>
      Similarly to the previous categories, I found that it was often able to help me understand code fairly well. It was helpful to get a line-by-line analysis when I felt confused, and I could later apply those lessons to future code I encountered.
      
  20. Writing code<br>
      I feel that a lot of the code I wrote in this class was made up of tools that we used or learned so I didn't really need to rely on AI to write out code much. Sometimes if I wondered if something could be more efficient, I would inquire about it. But I didn't always use the code that AI provided as it often had errors that I had to bugfix or other issues (for example, suspected security issues). It could usually provide a decent baseline or starting point, but I probably wouldn't rely heavily on it to solve more complex issues.

  21. Documenting code<br>
      I occassionally used it to help comment my code as it's much faster and it automatically adds proper formatting. I would review the comments to check that that they are correct and then add them or edit them so that they suited however I preferred to organize things in my project.

  22. Quality assurance<br>
      Quite frankly, I wasn't super impressed with its ability to analyze quality assurance. I think that it often didn't take many situations into account, and I often found that I was inquiring about whether certain things were good practice (my intuition was correct that they often weren't) or about checking for certain cases.
 
  24. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed above<br>
      I did not use AI for other uses in class.
