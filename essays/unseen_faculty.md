### I. Introduction


### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

  1. Experience WODs e.g. E18
      I didn't really need to utilize AI for the Experience WODs as I found the screencasts explaining steps to be much more useful personally. I liked being able to walk through problems and see problem solving strategies in action. 
     
  3. In-class Practice WODs

  4. In-class WODs
     I didn't need to use AI for the WODs. Instead, I attended many practice session WODS and reviewed answers to prepare. I found it more beneficial to understand each element used in the practice WODs and homeworks and then translate it to the new WOD.

  6. Essays
     I don't really like utilizing AI for essays. I don't really believe that AI captures my true voice and feelings as accurately as I would like.

  8. Final project

  9. Learning a concept / tutorial

  10. Answering a question in class or in Discord

  11. Asking or answering a smart-question
